# Surveillance Footage Blurring

Run rec_categorize_faces.py to launch a live video feed that recognizes faces and overlays boxes with different colors to categorize the faces on the feed. If the program detects a face that is not whitelisted (in the database) it will block out that face form the feed. If you want to add your own faces and categories, add sub folders to the photodb directory with the photos of a faces in there specific folder.
